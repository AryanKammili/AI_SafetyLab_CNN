# UTD AI Saftey Lab Coding Challenge ConvNN
 Convolutional neural network written for UTD AI Safety Lab 
 I didn't get in but I have my solution online so that others can learn in the future
 Please do not use code to cheat, rather this was published so that people in the future can learn
 This project taught me a lot about Convolutional Neural Networks and was my next big step into AI
